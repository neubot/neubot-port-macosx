\f0\fs24 \cf2 Neubot is a research project on network neutrality of the NEXA Center for Internet & Society at Politecnico di Torino. The project is based on a lightweight open source program that interested users can download and install on their computers. The program runs in the background and periodically performs transmission tests with test servers, hosted by the distributed Measurement Lab platform, and (in future) with other instances of the program itself. Transmission tests probe the Internet using various application level protocols and test results are saved both locally and on the test servers. The results dataset contains samples from various Providers and is published on the web, allowing anyone to analyze the data for research purposes.}
